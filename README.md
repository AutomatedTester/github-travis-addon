## Github + Travis

This is a simple addon that places the Travis CI Badge next to a project title on the page so you don't need to go to
the README to view it's status. This was inspired by [Tomas
Carnecky's Chrome Extension](https://github.com/wereHamster/github-travis-chrome-extension). This is a restartless
extension for Firefox and requires Firefox 4+ to work.
